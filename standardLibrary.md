# Standard Library 📚

The Standard Library in our language provides several built-in functions that help perform common tasks. These functions are always available for you to use in your programs. They are designed to be simple, flexible, and powerful.

## Native Functions 🏛️

Currently, we support two native functions:

### Print (اطبع) 🖨️

The `print` function outputs the value of its parameter. It is used like this:

```js
اطبع("Hello, World!");
```

### Prompt (اسال) ❓


The `prompt` function requests user input. It displays a dialog with a message prompting the user to input a text. It is used like this:


```js
var name = اسال("What is your name?");
```

In the above example, اسال is the keyword for the prompt function in our language, and "What is your name?" is the message to display to the user. The text entered by the user will be stored in the variable name.
Please note that the اسال function pauses execution of the program until the user responds to the prompt.


### toDecimal (الى-عشري) 🔢


The `toDecimal` function converts a string to a decimal number. It is used like this:


```js
var decimalNumber = toDecimal("3.14");
عرف متغير-عشري = الى-عشري("3.14");
```


### toInteger (الى-صحيح) 🔢


The `toInteger` function converts a string to an integer number. It is used like this:


```js
var integerNumber = toInteger("3");
عرف متغير-صحيح = الى-صحيح("3");
``` 


Keep an eye on this space, as we are working hard to add more functions to our Standard Library! 🚀
