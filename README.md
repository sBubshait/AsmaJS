# AsmaJS 🌙💻

Welcome to AsmaJS, the Arabic-oriented compiled programming language that seamlessly translates into JavaScript. Our goal is to foster linguistic diversity in tech, making coding more accessible for Arabic speakers. 

## Features 🚀
### Current Features ✅
- **Basic Binary Expressions**: AsmaJS supports basic binary operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as well as boolean operations like AND, OR, and NOT.
- **Simple Expressions**: The language can process and evaluate simple arithmetic and logical expressions.
- **Function Calls**: AsmaJS currently supports function calls, both built-in and user-defined functions.
- **Objects**: AsmaJS allows object creation and manipulation, extending the power of JavaScript's object-oriented programming to Arabic syntax.
- **Variable Declaration*: The language supports variable declaration and assignment, allowing users to store and manipulate data.

### To-Do List 📝
Here's what's on the horizon:

- [ ] **User-defined functions**: Allow users to define their own functions.
